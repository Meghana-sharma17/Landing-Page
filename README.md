Crafting a Captivating First Impression: My Oasis Internship Project

As part of my internship at Oasis, I was tasked with designing and developing this landing page. This project provided me with valuable experience in  HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I focused on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that effectively conveys the key message and encourages visitors to take action.

I'm proud of the final result and believe it showcases my ability to create engaging digital experiences."
